//node is just a runtime environment for server-side javascript
//express is a library of server side javascript (like jquery is for client-side)

//npm (node package manager) is tool we use to manage packages and libraries
    //npm init within our project sets up npm and puts in package.json file
//A server is something that is continuosly running, and when it gets a request it will send a response (req, res)

//When we download node modules, we don't want to commit all of them up to github
    //use .gitignore to place the modules you don't want 
    //DO NOT IGNORE THE GIT IGNORE (push that to github)
